Before we began pre-processing our data, we had to create an 'author' category. This is because the data is read in without a label category already created and one is needed for our classification problem at hand. Note that the pre-processing we detail are the steps taken for both our training AND test set.

We create two empty lists: an empty list (henceforth file list) to contain each file of the training/test documents, and another empty list that will contain the author's name and their number of writings (henceforth label list). After this, we can now begin to extract the author and file names.

We iterate through every folder name within the corpus and extracts the folder name itself (because each folder represents one author and their writings). The loop continues and extracts the file name of each writing within an author folder before appending the file to our file list. At the end of each loop, we append the author name and their number of files to our label list.

Now that we have our file list, we can read in the files with a readPlain function to read in every file name in English and also assign a unique ID for each file. With this function we assign it to a newly initialized list whose elements are the file names of every document in the training/test directory. However, we check the names of this list and see that the file names still need to be scrubbed as each file ends with a '.txt' extension. 

With our proper file names for every document we create corpuses out of them. We initialize the corpus. Once the corpus is initialized, we need to run some pre-processing on each document. We make everything lowercase and remove any numbers, punctuation, or excess white space. Finally, we remove any words under the 'en' stopwords.

The document-term matrix is now initialized from our cleaned up corpus. In our training DTM, we will remove any sparse terms in the matrix and set our criteria for terms that did not appear in 99% of our documents. In our test DTM, we ensure that all words of the training DTM are included by specifying it as a control within the test DTM initialization. The DTMs use term frequency as their weighting criterion. With our DTMs constructed we can now begin modeling our data and analysis of the model.
